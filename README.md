## Description and instructions

This project is a small chrome extension that allows to fetch information about a position currently displayed in the browser and save it in order to track job applications. It allows to export the saved data as a csv file (for the moment with a predetermined format).

As of now, I've only tested running the app in dev mode. To do that:

- Run the following command: `npm run dev`
- In Chrome, go in the Extensions settings. On there, click on "Load unpacked" and select the /dist folder of the extension.

## Credits

I use the following library to facilitate loading a React app into the extension: https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin.
